[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jrheard/cryptopals.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jrheard/cryptopals)

My implementations of the [CryptoPals](http://cryptopals.com/) challenges. See the `test` directory for proof of completion for each of the challenges I've made it through.

I've been pleasantly surprised at how natural a fit Clojure is for these challenges - 99% of this stuff is just pure functions!

Don't read this code if you haven't done the challenges and plan to do them - the challenges are very fun, and most of that fun comes from deciphering the instructions and trying to figure out how in the hell you're going to overcome these often-seemingly-insurmountable problems.
